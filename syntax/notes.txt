	:: taskParameter=rValue 
	

rValue can be:
 * a literal
 * branch point definition, that is
 	(branchPointName: branchName1=rValue branchName2=rValue)
 * branch point definition with a sequence, that is
 	(branchPointName: number1..number2) 	
 * config variable (a reference to something in a config file)
 * reference to a variable, that is $taskParameter
 * reference to a task output, that is $outputVariable@taskName
 * reference to a task output with a branch graft, that is 
 	$outputVariable@taskName[branchPointName:branchNameOrGlob] or
 	$outputVariable@taskName[branchPointName1:branchName1OrGlob,branchPointName2:branchName2OrGlob,branchPointName3:branchName3OrGlob]
 * unbound is the absence of an rValue
 
 
 branchNameOrGlob can either be a branchName or *
