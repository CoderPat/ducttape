File Versions
=============

File versions will be implemented by storing MD5 hashes of files in either a standoff file or the workflow's sqlite DB. These won't be re-checked during every workflow startup for efficiency reasons, but can be re-checked on demand to ensure consistency.

Note to self: Recruit Matt Post to implement this cachepipe style.
